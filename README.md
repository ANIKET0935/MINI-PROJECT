# MINI-PROJECT
Project Summary
The "Innovative Clap Switch: Integrating IR Detection with Arduino" is a smart control system that combines sound (clap) detection and infrared (IR) presence sensing. Unlike basic clap switches, this project enhances functionality by adding IR detection, which minimizes false triggers and improves response accuracy. The system is ideal for hands-free control of devices like lights or fans, especially in smart home and security applications.

Objectives
Hands-Free Control: Use clap sounds to toggle devices without physical switches.
Motion Detection: Employ an IR sensor to detect motion or presence, making the system more responsive to environmental cues.
Energy Efficiency: Automatically control device states, reducing unnecessary energy usage.
